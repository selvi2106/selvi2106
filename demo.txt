  Project Title:
Predicting Energy Consumption Patterns Using Time Series Forecasting for Smart Grids

Objective of the Demo:
To showcase the workflow, data analysis, model prediction, and web dashboard that forecasts future energy demand based on historical data.

 Tools Required:
Python 3.8+

Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

Flask (for web app demo)

Browser (e.g., Chrome)

Model file: trained_model.pkl

Dataset: smart_grid_energy_consumption.csv
 Demo Steps:
1. Data Analysis (Jupyter or Colab)
Open EDA_and_Model.ipynb or Colab notebook.

Run the notebook cells step-by-step:

Load the dataset

Perform EDA (plots: histogram, scatter plot, boxplot)

Time series decomposition

Model training (ARIMA or LSTM)

Forecast future values

Explain:

How seasonality and temperature affect usage

Why certain models were chosen (e.g., ARIMA for stationary data)

 2. Model Prediction
Load the trained model (trained_model.pkl).

Generate future predictions for 30 time steps.

Visualize actual vs predicted values (using matplotlib or plotly).

Explain:

RMSE/MAE scores

Forecast graph insights

 3. Web Dashboard Demo (Flask)
Run the app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python source.py
Open browser and go to:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:5000
Show:

Line chart of predictions

Prediction table

Real-time style dashboard with forecast

Explain:

Flask structure

How data is passed from model to web

4. Dashboard (Optional – Power BI or Plotly Dash)
If available, open interactive dashboard:

Filter by time, month, substation

Highlight peak periods

Visual summaries

 Explain:

How business teams can use this data

 Key Talking Points:
What insights were derived from EDA (e.g., peak usage hours, temperature effects)?

Why time series forecasting is important in smart grids?

How can utilities benefit from this system (load planning, cost savings)?

Future improvements: Real-time data pipeline, D3.js visualization, CRM alerts
